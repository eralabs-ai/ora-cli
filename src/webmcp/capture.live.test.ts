/**
 * The one test that drives a real browser.
 *
 * Skipped unless `AX_WEBMCP_LIVE=1`, because it drives a real browser that CI
 * does not have. It is the manual-verification harness for the capture:
 *
 *   AX_WEBMCP_LIVE=1 pnpm test src/webmcp/capture.live.test.ts
 *
 * It launches its own Chrome the same way the command does - no flags, a
 * throwaway profile, stopped again afterwards - so there is nothing to start
 * first. Set `AX_WEBMCP_CHROME` to a `host:port` to drive one you started
 * instead.
 *
 * The page it serves is a target, not a payload fixture: it exists to make the
 * browser register a tool. Every value the audit is graded on still comes from
 * a real capture of it.
 *
 * Note what this asserts about pass A. Shim v1 reads `nativeApi` AFTER the
 * page's scripts have run, so it is true when the browser provides WebMCP and
 * ALSO when the page installs a polyfill. The target page below does neither,
 * so on a stock Chrome it must be false - the same answer ora's capture browser
 * gives. A Chrome started with `--enable-features=WebMCPTesting` answers true
 * and flips the page verdict from `testing-only` to `active`, which is the
 * local-vs-published divergence `webmcpParityWarning` exists to catch, so this
 * test failing on `nativeApi` most likely means the wrong Chrome is on the port.
