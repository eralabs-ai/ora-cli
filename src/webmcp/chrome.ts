/**
 * Finding a Chrome to capture with, and refusing to capture with the wrong one.
 *
 * Two rules govern this file:
 *
 *  - **Never download a browser** (design decision #6). This starts, or
 *    attaches to, a Chrome the developer already has installed. When it cannot
 *    find one it says how to install or locate one; it never fetches one.
 *  - **Say so when the browser itself provides WebMCP.** ora's capture browser
 *    has no WebMCP support at all, and pass A asks whether `modelContext` is
 *    there without the shim having installed it. On a Chrome started with
 *    `--enable-features=WebMCPTesting` that answers yes for every site,
 *    `real-browser-eligible` passes, and the page verdict comes back `active`
 *    where ora would say `testing-only` - measured on one page, captured twice
 *    by identical code, with only the flag different. The whole point of the
 *    command is that a local run predicts the published one, so
 *    `webmcpParityWarning` below refuses to let that pass silently.
