/**
 * The terminal report for `ax webmcp-audit`.
 *
 * Thin client (design decision #1): every judgement here arrived decided. The
 * availability gate, grade, score, pillar scores, evidence coverage, each
 * finding's status and `details`, and the whole simulation come from the server
 * payload and are rendered as given. Nothing in this file re-derives a number
 * or rewrites a sentence.
 *
 * Three distinctions the rendering must not collapse:
 *
 *  - **Availability is a gate, not a pillar.** Whether an agent can use the
 *    page at all is decided before anything is scored. A `not-ready` page has
 *    no score and no grade, and its reasons are the whole answer - printing an
 *    empty scorecard beside them would bury the part that matters.
 *  - **`na` vs `unmeasured`.** `na` means the check had nothing to measure and
 *    the site is not charged for it. `unmeasured` means it applied and was not
 *    measured, and it counts against evidence coverage. Showing both as
 *    "skipped" would erase a line the server draws deliberately.
 *  - **A withheld grade beside a real score.** Below the coverage threshold the
 *    server reports the score and withholds the letter. That is a normal state,
 *    not an error, and the report says why rather than showing a blank.
 *
 * A pillar reading 0 is ambiguous in the same way: it can mean "measured,
 * earned nothing" or "had nothing to measure". `categoryScores` does not
 * distinguish them, so this file does not guess - it marks a pillar whose
 * findings are all `na`/`unmeasured`, which is a fact about the findings rather
 * than a re-derivation of the score.
 *
 * A local audit is scored and returned and then forgotten. It is not stored,
 * published, ranked, or reachable by anyone else, and no copy here may suggest
 * it is.
